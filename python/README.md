# Python Utility Scripts

This folder contains several utility scripts which are not used by the pipeline itself but can be useful for operating it. Here is a list:

- **createRun.py**:         creates a run.sh file according to the settings you want to use
- **loadingFunctions.py**:  contains a number of loading functions for easy access to the results
- **main.py**:              contains basic plots for each output of the pipeline for quick visualization
- **kernel.py**:            contains a python version of the SPH-kernel functions. In case you need that.
